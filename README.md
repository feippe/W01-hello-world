# Overview

This simple software project prints the message "Hello World" to the console.  
The purpose of this project is to verify that my development environment is properly set up and that I can create, run, and publish software successfully.  
As a software engineer, this helps me practice using Git, GitHub, and video documentation — skills that are essential for real-world development work.
